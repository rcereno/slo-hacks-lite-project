        <h1>AssessMental</h1>

        <h2>"Close to 800,000 people die due to suicide every year. Suicide is the second leading cause of death in 15-29-year-olds."</h2>
         
        <h3>Cited from the World Health Organization in early 2020, this quote represents the deadly dangers of how poor mental health can affect individuals all around the world. 
            Especially during these times with COVID-19, many people are prone to these detrimental influences. Social distancing, isolation, and the stress of the pandemic have 
            the ability to let anxiety and depression emerge, which are the two most common mental illnesses in the nation. </h3>

        <h3>Passionate about stopping these effects, we, a team of four students from California Polytechnic State University at San Luis Obispo, seek to provide a 
            space of comfort to anyone struggling with their mental state.</h3>
